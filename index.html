												<dd>

												</dd>
												<dt>2. Can I contact the "Citizenship by Investment Unit" (CIU) directly?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>No, the CIU limits its communication to ‘Authorized Persons’. An ‘Authorized Person’ is an individual or entity approved by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FRSC) of Saint Kitts and Nevis licensed to conduct corporate or trust services in Saint Kitts and Nevis. An ‘Authorized Person’ is appointed by the main applicant by way of Limited Power of Attorney to act on their behalf in relation to all matters regarding their Citizenship by Investment application. The ‘Authorized Person’ is required to provide professional advice, assist and give details regarding the process and help with the preparation and submission of an application for Citizenship by investment and its supporting documents. The ‘Authorized Person’ will communicate with the Citizenship by Investment Unit and maintain a point of contact to review all matters surrounding the application, make payments and submit and collect all important correspondences.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>3. Are the application forms available online?</dt>

												</dd>
												<dt>5. Can I submit my application in a language other than English?</dt>

												</dd>

												<dd>
													<p>There is <b>no limit</b> on the number of permitted dependents.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>11. What are the fees involved?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>All applicants and permitted dependents are required to pay due diligence and processing fees, which will be presented by the ‘Authorized Person’ at application.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>12. Can an applicant remit fees directly to the CIU?</dt>
												<dd>

												</dd>
												<dt>13. If I am no longer interested in becoming a citizen, will my monies be refunded?</dt>
