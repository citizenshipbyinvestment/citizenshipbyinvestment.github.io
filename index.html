							<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
							<p>Saint Kitts and Nevis, also known as ‘Saint Christopher and Nevis’ forms part of the group of islands known as the Lesser Antilles, located some 2,000 km to the southeast of the state of Florida. Saint Kitts and Nevis was home to the first British and French colonies in the Caribbean, and thus has also been titled "The Mother Colony of the West Indies". The country has beautiful beaches, reefs, wonderful cool climate, enjoyable throughout the year. The country is also well connected by direct and easy flights from Canada, many cities in the US, Europe, and most Caribbean airliners.</p>

											<h3>Questions:</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">

											<dl>
												<dt>1. What are the requirements of becoming a Saint Kitts and Nevis citizen by investment?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The main applicant must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, must have made an investment in the prescribed amount, and must meet other application requirements.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>2. Can I contact the Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) directly?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The CIU only engages with ‘Authorized Persons’. An ‘Authorized Person’ is an individual or entity approved by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FRSC) of Saint Kitts and Nevis licensed to conduct corporate or trust services in Saint Kitts and Nevis. An ‘Authorized Person’ is appointed by the main applicant by way of Limited Power of Attorney to act on their behalf in relation to all matters regarding their Citizenship by Investment application. The ‘Authorized Person’ is required to provide professional advice, assist and give details regarding the application process and help with the preparation and submission of an application for Citizenship by investment and its supporting documents. The ‘Authorized Person’ will communicate with the Citizenship by Investment Unit and maintain a point of contact to review all matters surrounding the application, make payments and submit and collect all important correspondences.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>3. Are the application forms available online?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The application forms for Citizenship by Investment can only be obtained and submitted to the Citizenship by Investment Unit by an ‘Authorized Person’.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>4. How long does the application process take?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The application process may take as little as 60~90 days but may be delayed depending on the profile of the applicant. Applicants will be kept informed of the status of their applications through their ‘Authorized Person’.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>5. Can I submit my application in a language other than English?</dt>

												</dd>
												<dt>6. Can two or more applicants apply for citizenship by investment together?</dt>

												<dd>
													<p>There is no limit on the number of permitted dependents.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>11. What are the fees involved?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>All applicants and permitted dependents are required to pay due diligence and processing fees, which will be presented by the ‘Authorized Person’ at application.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>12. Can an applicant remit fees directly to the CIU?</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>No, all applicants are required to pay the processing fees, the due diligence fees as well as the Government fees through their chosen ‘Authorized Person’. Wire transfers to the Unit are only applicable for approved applicants for the remittance of Sustainable Growth Fund contributions.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>13. If I am no longer interested in becoming a citizen, will my monies be refunded?</dt>
												<dd>
